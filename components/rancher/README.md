# Deploy Rancher


Before installing Rancher, you need to configure the docker correctly to use the docker registry installed
in step (1) . The file [/etc/docker/daemon.json](../etc/docker/daemon.json) is the docker configuration example,
which you can refer to make your docker configuration file and you should
put the file into the folder /etc/docker of your machine, and the file name should be daemon.json as well.


Accessing Clusters with kubectl and a kubeconfig File
Alternatively, you can access your clusters by installing kubectl on your workstation, and then directing it toward a kubeconfig file automatically generated by Rancher. After install and configuration, you can access your clusters without logging into Rancher.

Install kubectl on your workstation. For more information, see Kubernetes Documentation: Install and Set Up kubectl.

Log into Rancher. From the Global view, open the cluster that you want to access with kubectl.

Copy the clusterâ€™s kubeconfig file to your workstation.

Click Kubeconfig File.

Copy the contents displayed to your clipboard.

Paste the contents into a new file on your local computer. Move the file to ~/.kube/config.

NOTE:
The default location that kubectl uses for the kubeconfig file is ~/.kube/config, but you can use any directory and specify it using the --kubeconfig flag, as in the sample that follows:

kubectl --kubeconfig /custom/path/kube.config get pods
From your workstation, launch kubectl. Use it to interact with your kubernetes cluster.

If you have launched a Rancher Launched Kubernetes cluster and want to use kubectl without using Rancher, see Kubeconfig Files.

For more information on using kubectl, see Kubernetes Documentation: Overview of kubectl.
